# BookLens App - Project Status Report

## Project Overview
BookLens App is a full-stack application for book search and management, built with a modern tech stack including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React/TypeScript.

## Architecture
The project follows a client-server architecture with separate frontend and backend applications:

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with Passport.js
- **Caching**: Redis implementation
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Modern build setup with TypeScript configuration
- **Package Management**: npm

## Current Status

### Backend Features
- ✅ Express server setup with TypeScript
- ✅ MongoDB integration with connection retry logic
- ✅ Authentication system with JWT
- ✅ Redis caching implementation
- ✅ API documentation with Swagger
- ✅ Security middleware implementation
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Cache monitoring and management
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### Frontend Features
- ✅ React application setup with TypeScript
